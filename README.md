# 🌍 MediShareNet: Tokenized Health Data Ecosystem for Global Research

Welcome to MediShareNet, an enhanced decentralized platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts! This Web3 project revolutionizes medical research by incentivizing patients to share anonymized health data, with a focus on rare diseases and global health challenges. MediShareNet addresses the critical issue of fragmented health data by creating a secure, transparent ecosystem where patients earn MSH tokens for contributing data, and researchers access aggregated insights for breakthroughs. Upgraded features include dynamic reward scaling, AI-driven data validation, and cross-chain interoperability for broader impact.

## ✨ Features

🔒 Enhanced privacy with zero-knowledge proofs for anonymized data submission  
💰 MSH token rewards with dynamic scaling for rare conditions and high-quality data  
🔬 Advanced query engine for researchers to access aggregated datasets with customizable filters  
🏆 Gamified incentives, including leaderboards and milestone bonuses for contributors  
🗳️ Decentralized governance with tiered voting power based on token staking  
📊 Auditable data trails with on-chain contribution and reward tracking  
🛡️ Robust anti-fraud with AI-assisted validation and oracle integration  
🌐 Cross-chain bridge for token interoperability with Ethereum and Bitcoin L2s  
🤝 Collaborative research bounties for targeted data campaigns  

## 🛠 How It Works

MediShareNet leverages 9 Clarity smart contracts to create a scalable, privacy-first platform. Patients submit anonymized data (e.g., hashed medical records, genomic data, or symptom logs), earning MSH tokens based on data rarity and quality. Researchers stake tokens to query aggregated datasets, fueling a self-sustaining economy. Cross-chain support and AI validation enhance accessibility and trust.

### Smart Contracts Overview

1. **UserRegistryContract**: Manages anonymous registration for patients and researchers, now with zero-knowledge proof integration for enhanced privacy.  
2. **DataSubmissionContract**: Handles hashed data uploads with metadata (e.g., condition type, data format). Includes duplicate prevention and format standardization.  
3. **DataVerificationContract**: Upgraded with AI-driven scoring (via oracle) and community validation to assess data quality, rewarding higher for rare or complex datasets.  
4. **MSHTokenContract**: Fungible token contract (SIP-010 compliant) for minting, transferring, and burning MSH tokens, with staking support for governance.  
5. **RewardPoolContract**: Distributes dynamic rewards based on data rarity, quality, and contribution frequency, with gamified bonuses for top contributors.  
6. **ResearchAccessContract**: Enhanced query engine allowing researchers to filter datasets (e.g., by condition, region, or time) while staking MSH tokens.  
7. **GovernanceContract**: DAO with tiered voting (based on staked MSH) for adjusting reward algorithms, adding conditions, or approving cross-chain bridges.  
8. **EscrowContract**: Manages secure token escrows for bounties, premium queries, or collaborative research campaigns.  
9. **CrossChainBridgeContract**: New contract enabling MSH token transfers to Ethereum or Bitcoin L2s, expanding liquidity and researcher access.  

### For Patients (Data Contributors)

- Register anonymously via UserRegistryContract using zero-knowledge proofs.  
- Generate a SHA-256 hash of anonymized health data (e.g., lab results, wearables data).  
- Submit to DataSubmissionContract with:  
  - Data hash  
  - Condition category (e.g., "rare neurological disorder")  
  - Optional metadata (e.g., age range, region)  
- Data is validated by DataVerificationContract using AI oracles and community checks.  
- Earn MSH tokens from RewardPoolContract, with bonuses for rare conditions or consistent contributions (tracked on leaderboards).  
- Stake MSH tokens to vote in GovernanceContract or transfer them cross-chain via CrossChainBridgeContract.  

Your data fuels global research while earning you rewards in a vibrant ecosystem!

### For Researchers

- Register via UserRegistryContract with a verified researcher profile.  
- Stake MSH tokens in ResearchAccessContract to query datasets with advanced filters (e.g., "symptom trends for Condition Y in Asia").  
- Propose targeted data bounties (e.g., for a specific rare disease) via EscrowContract.  
- Vote on platform upgrades in GovernanceContract.  
- Use CrossChainBridgeContract to bring MSH tokens from Ethereum or Bitcoin L2s for payments.  

Access cutting-edge insights with full transparency and contribute to the reward pool.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install a Stacks wallet (e.g., Hiro Wallet).  
2. Deploy the 9 Clarity contracts on the Stacks testnet using Clarinet.  
3. Interact via a dApp frontend or Stacks Explorer.  
4. Test cross-chain functionality with Ethereum testnets (e.g., Sepolia).  

MediShareNet supercharges global health research with a privacy-first, tokenized ecosystem, now with cross-chain support and AI-driven validation for greater trust and scalability.
